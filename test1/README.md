## Test-1
### Your mission should you choose to accept
1. Make a new array of objects called **productNamePrice** from the products array; it should contain only `productName` and `productPrice`
2. You'll notice that some products have the same name, make a function called **leastPriceWithThisName** which will take one parameter (name). It should return the product with least price which has the parameter `name` passed to the function
 	- function format -> ```leastPriceWithThisName(name)```
3. Extract the total quantity of items from the carts array.
4. Extract a cart item with the least price and a cart item with the max price.
5. Calculate the total price of the cart, keep in mind any discounts applied to a cart item.
Hint:

- Do Not use `for-loops` nor `forEach`.
- It's encouraged that you divide your code into **pure** functions.
- The way you format your overall code will be closely analyzed.
