## Test-1
 1. Make a new array of objects called **productNamePrice** from the products array; it should contain only `productName` and `productPrice`
 2. Make a function called **leastPriceWithThisName** which will take one param (name). It should return the product with least price which has the `name` passed to the function
 	- function format -> ```leastPriceWithThisName(name)```

Hint:

- Do Not use `for-loops`
- It's encouraged that you divide your code into **pure** functions
